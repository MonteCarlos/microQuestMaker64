# microQuestMaker64
===================
microQuestMaker64 is a native Commodore 64 application that makes it easy to design small text adventure games in the tradition of "Zork" or the legendary "Cave" adventure. It will run in an emulator as well as on native C64 hardware. At the moment, it supports up to 100 rooms and 30 objects within a single game. Although the program is still incomplete and under development, you can already edit rooms, define objects, and test-run your game. Game data is stored in the Commodore "REL" file format, allowing random access of records. Coding is done utilizing the cc65 cross-compiler.
